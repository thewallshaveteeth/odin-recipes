    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>These chickpeas have had their fair share of Instagram fame for many reasons. 
        The first is the dish's simplicity: throw everything into a pan and pop it into the oven, leaving it to its own devices (and you to yours). 
        The second is that slow-cooking the chickpeas in oil without added liquid makes them super soft, allowing all the aromatics to break down into the oil. 
        Lastly, this dish can easily be made ahead and served later; it only improves with time. 
        Swap out Greek yoghurt with a non-dairy alternative for a completely vegan meal, and serve with rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tins of chickpeas (800g), drained (480g)</li>
        <li>11 garlic cloves, peeled, 10 left whole and 1 crushed</li>
        <li>30g	fresh ginger, peeled and julienned</li>
        <li>400g datterini or regular cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 red chillies, mild or spicy, a slit cut down their length</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed with a pestle and mortar</li>
        <li>2 tsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed with a pestle and mortar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp	ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp	chilli flakes</li>
        <li>2 tsp red Kashmiri chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>200ml olive oil</li>
        <li>180g Greek-style yoghurt</li>
        <li>15g	picked mint leaves</li>
        <li>30g	fresh coriander, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2-3	limes: juiced to get 1 tbsp and the rest cut into wedges to serve</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150°C fan.</li>
        <li>Put the chickpeas, whole garlic cloves, ginger, tomatoes, chillies, tomato paste, spices, sugar, oil and 1 teaspoon of salt into a large sauté pan, for which you have a lid, and mix everything together to combine. 
            Cover with the lid, transfer to the oven and cook for 75 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the aromatics have softened and the tomatoes have nicely broken down.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, put the yoghurt, mint, fresh coriander, lime juice, crushed garlic and 1/4 teaspoon of salt into a food processor and blitz until smooth and the herbs are finely chopped.</li>
        <li>Serve the chickpeas directly from the pan, with the yoghurt and lime wedges alongside.</li>
    </ol>
