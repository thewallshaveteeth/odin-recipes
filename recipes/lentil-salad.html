    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the boiling water from the kettle into a saucepan over a medium heat and bring back to the boil. 
            Add the eggs and set a timer for 61/2 minutes (for soft-boiled).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, put the garlic clove and most of the parsley and basil, stalks and all, into a mini food processor. 
            Blitz until finely chopped. Add the yogurt and blitz briefly to combine. 
            Season the yogurt with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Get a large frying pan over a high heat. 
            Tip in the sun-dried tomatoes with their oil and the bag of spinach. 
            Squeeze the unopened lentil pouches with your hands to break up the lentils, then open and tip them into the pan. 
            Add a splash of hot water from the kettle. 
            Season with salt and black pepper, stir and leave to heat through.</li>
        <li>Drain the eggs into a sieve when cooked and run under cold water until cool enough to handle, then peel and halve. 
            Cut the lemon into four wedges and roughly chop the cashews.</li>
        <li>Spoon the lentils into four bowls. 
            Drizzle over the herby yogurt, then top each bowl with a halved soft-boiled egg. 
            Tear over the remaining herbs and scatter over the chopped cashews. 
            Season with salt and black pepper and serve with the lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
